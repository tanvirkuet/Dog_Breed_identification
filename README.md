Dog Vision project
This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog,given an image of a dog.

if I saw a dog, I wll capture an image and do my model find the breed of that dog

This kind of problem is called multi-class image classification. It's multi-class because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog. If we were only trying to classify dogs versus cats, it would be called binary classification.
